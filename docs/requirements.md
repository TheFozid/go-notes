---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

**Achieved (v1.1):**
- Fast connection times (<1 second for note loading)
- Database indexes for common queries (3-5x faster)
- N+1 query prevention (batch loading)
- Bundle size optimization (57% reduction in initial load)
- Code splitting (quill, yjs, vendor chunks)
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Search debouncing (500ms)
- Rate limiting prevents abuse

**Targets:**
- Support unlimited folder nesting without performance degradation ✅
- Handle multiple concurrent WebSocket connections ✅
- Fast subsequent document loads (documents cached by Hocuspocus) ✅
- Initial page load: <2 seconds on 3G ✅
- Note switching: <500ms ✅

**Future optimizations:**
- Large document testing (>10MB notes)
- Connection pooling optimization
- Hocuspocus memory management tuning
- CDN for static assets

### Security

**Must implement:**
- JWT tokens validated against database
- Tokens for deleted users rejected immediately
- Role-based endpoint protection
- Hocuspocus WebSocket authentication via JWT
- Workspace membership enforced at Hocuspocus layer
- JWT_SECRET configurable via environment variable
- Backend proxies Hocuspocus WebSocket (single external port)
- Password hashing (bcrypt)

**Future enhancements:**
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Rate limiting on Hocuspocus connections
- CORS configuration for production
- Content Security Policy headers
- SSL/TLS for WebSocket in production

**Production Security (Implemented v1.1):**
- JWT_SECRET must be set (application fails to start without it)
- Rate limiting: 5 requests/minute for authentication, 60/minute for general API
- CORS configuration via environment variable
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries with field whitelist
- Input validation on all mutation endpoints
- Password strength requirements (bcrypt with cost 10)

**Production Security (Future):**
- Content Security Policy headers
- Brute force protection (account lockout)
- SSL/TLS certificate management
- Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

### Deployment

**Must support:**
- Single Docker Compose deployment (3 services: db, backend, yjs)
- Backend serves frontend static files
- Backend proxies Hocuspocus WebSocket traffic
- All configuration via `.env` file
- Automatic database migrations on startup
- Hocuspocus document persistence to PostgreSQL
- Single external port with configurable subpath (API_BASE_PATH)

**Future enhancements:**
- Production-ready Docker images (multi-stage builds)
- Health check endpoints
- Monitoring and logging setup
- Backup and restore procedures
- Documentation for reverse proxy setup

### Usability

**Must provide:**
- Intuitive workspace/folder/note tree navigation
- Context menus for all actions
- Visual feedback for all operations
- Color-coded notes for visual organization
- Fast search with immediate feedback
- Tag-based navigation
- Clear trash system with restore capability

**Future enhancements:**
- Loading states for async operations
- Error toasts/notifications
- Connection status indicator
- Keyboard shortcuts for navigation
- Mobile responsive design

## Design Constraints

### Editing Model
- Rich text via Hocuspocus CRDT (automatic conflict resolution)
- Content stored in PostgreSQL via Hocuspocus Database extension
- Metadata (title, color, tags, yjs_room_id) stored in PostgreSQL `notes` table
- No custom edit events - Hocuspocus handles all synchronization
- Each note = one Hocuspocus document with room ID format: `w{workspace_id}_n{note_id}`

### Conflict Resolution
- CRDT approach (automatic merge of concurrent edits)
- No manual conflict resolution needed
- Undo isolated per user (Hocuspocus UndoManager)
- Conflicts resolved at character level

### Folder Deletion
- Must trash notes (not permanently delete)
- Must cascade delete child folders
- Trashed notes moved to parent folder (or workspace root if no parent)

### Content Storage
- Hocuspocus documents in the `notes.content` column
- PostgreSQL stores metadata separately in `notes` table
- Title stored for search/display (updated manually for now)
- `notes.content_text` holds plain text extracted by the client, for search

### Authentication Flow
1. User authenticates with backend (receives JWT)
2. Frontend fetches note metadata (includes yjs_room_id)
3. Frontend connects to Hocuspocus WebSocket via backend proxy with JWT token
4. Backend proxies to Hocuspocus at internal port
5. Hocuspocus validates JWT with backend via `/validate-yjs-token`
6. Hocuspocus checks workspace membership
7. Connection allowed/denied based on validation result

### Network Architecture
- Single external port (configurable via PORT)
- Single subpath (configurable via API_BASE_PATH)
- Backend serves frontend at `http://host:PORT/API_BASE_PATH/`
- Backend API at `http://host:PORT/API_BASE_PATH/`
- Hocuspocus WebSocket at `ws://host:PORT/API_BASE_PATH/yjs/`
- Works behind reverse proxy with custom port and subpath

## UI/UX Requirements

### Layout
- Flexbox, with a responsive breakpoint at 768px
- Top bar (56px) with breadcrumb, sync status and account menu
- Sidebar (resizable; width and open state remembered) for search, notes, tags
- On mobile the sidebar is a slide-over drawer that closes on selection
- Note header with title, tags and colour, above the formatting toolbar
- Overflow formatting controls behind a "More" button
- Editor text capped to a readable column width
- Account settings in a dialog, not a docked panel

### Workspace Tree
- Hierarchical display (workspaces → folders → notes)
- Unlimited folder nesting
- Context menus for all node types
- Visual indicators for trash
- Color-coded notes
- Expandable/collapsible nodes

### Note Editor
- Rich text formatting toolbar
- Color picker for note background
- Tag input with dropdown list
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+B, Ctrl+I, Ctrl+Z, etc.)
- Real-time collaboration indicators (cursors)
- Clean, distraction-free interface

### Tags Section
- Collapsible section in left panel
- Alphabetically sorted tag list
- Note count per tag
- Expandable tags show all notes with that tag
- Click note to open in editor

### Search Section
- Search input in left panel
- Placeholder text: "Search..."
- 500ms debounce
- Results show note title and metadata
- Result count display
- Click result to open note

### User Management
- Two-tab interface (Account, Users)
- All users can view and edit their account
- Admins can manage all users
- Single-admin enforcement
- Clear role indicators

## Success Criteria

### Phase 5 + UI Polish (Complete)
- ✅ Quill editor integrates with Hocuspocus
- ✅ Content persists to PostgreSQL
- ✅ All Quill formatting options implemented
- ✅ Note colors work correctly
- ✅ Per-user undo/redo works
- ✅ Real-time collaboration verified (2+ users)
- ✅ Cursor tracking works
- ✅ Tags add/remove/navigate works
- ✅ Search by title and tags works
- ✅ Material Symbols icons throughout
- ✅ Dynamic note path in title bar
- ✅ Panels hidden by default
- ✅ Perfect toolbar scrolling
- ✅ All dropdowns working correctly

### Phase 6 (Future)
- 🔄 Offline editing verified
- 🔄 Mobile responsive design
- 🔄 Production deployment successful

---

## Known Limitations

### Current
- Content search relies on the client having synced `content_text`, so a note
  not opened since that feature landed will not match on its content until it
  is opened and edited again
- No automated tests (manual testing only)
- Authentication warning in console (cosmetic)

### Design Decisions
- Content stored as binary Yjs documents, with plain text mirrored to
  `content_text` so it stays searchable
- No content_text column (would require sync mechanism, adds complexity)
- Title stored separately for search/display (acceptable tradeoff)
- Tags provide additional searchability alongside title and content search
